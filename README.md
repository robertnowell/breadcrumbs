## Implementation           
This prototype is built using the swift standard library, and we are currently developing a more sophisticated prototype with openGL. The app is written in Swift.    

A challenging aspect of implenting this prototype was Breadcrumb positioning with respect to a rotating device. This prototype relies upon a proprietary quaternion rotation system. We will likely look to leverage existing libraries and tools in the future, instead.  
 
## Non-technical Description  
The idea for the application is that there is a lot of information that  

1.  people would care to see.  
2.  is connected to a specific location , and  
3.  is relevant to a specific time period.  

For example, a hiking trail has dangerous ice in sections of the trail, so Rangers leave a Breadcrumb at the trailhead. Or you're about to have a pop quiz in your high school geography class, so a classmate from an earlier class leaves a heads up at the door to class. Another example: a friend is having a party, and she leaves the wifi password as a Breadcrumb at the door.  

The ux is something like the following: with the app open as it might be for Pokemon Go, geolocated messages will appear at specific locations, often at a doorstep. We think this is very cool, and look forward to working on it.
