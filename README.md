# breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs is an augmented reality geotagged messaging application for ios. Submission by Prateek Patil and Robert Nowell for AT&amp;T AR/VR Hackathon, November 2016. First prize, AR.

This prototype is built using the swift standard library, and we are currently developing a more sophisticated prototype with openGL. The language, of course, is Swift.  

The idea for the application is that there is a lot of information that is (1) useful, (2) connected to a specific location, and (3) relevant to a specific time period. For example, a store you love is having a special sale, a hiking trail has dangerous ice in sections of the trail, or you're about to have a pop quiz in your high school geography class.  

The ux is something like the following: with the app open as it might be for Pokemon Go, geolocated messages will appear at specific locations, often at a doorstep (another example: a friend is having a party, and she leaves the wifi password as a Breadcrumb at the door). We think this is very cool, and look forward to working on it.
